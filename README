### About

- So i will be solving/learning algorithms and Data structures as in this [post](https://matklad.github.io/2023/08/13/role-of-algorithms.html) from leetcode.
- writing proofs using dafny to understand them better.(rocq is too hard for me.)

- [ ] linear search.


- [ ] binary search

- [ ] quadratic sorting

- [ ] merge sort

- [ ] heap sort

- [ ] binary heap

- [ ] growable array

- [ ] doubly-linked list

- [ ] binary search tree

- [ ] AVL tree

- [ ]Red Black Tree

- [ ] B-tree

- [ ] Splay Tree
